# Development Notes

## 2026-09-20 — RainMachine internal scheduling and future software development

### Background

RainMachine hardware development appears to have largely stopped, and controller firmware development appears dormant. The purpose of this investigation is **not** to move irrigation scheduling into Indigo or RainMachine2. The preferred architecture is deliberately distributed: the RainMachine should remain an autonomous irrigation appliance that can continue to operate independently, while RainMachine2 communicates asynchronously with it for status, monitoring, and supervisory/control functions.

The concern is therefore the long-term maintainability and possible modification of the **internal RainMachine irrigation algorithms**, especially scheduling, ETo/weather adjustment, soil-water accounting, and handling of schedule conflicts.

### Scheduling behavior of interest

RainMachine's normal weather-adaptive approach primarily varies watering duration according to calculated weather/ET demand. A practical problem is that high ETo can extend program durations enough that watering programs overlap, collide with later programs, or run outside the originally intended watering window.

Rachio provides an interesting alternative model. Its Flex-style scheduling uses a soil-moisture/depletion model to vary **watering frequency** rather than simply increasing or decreasing the duration of every scheduled irrigation. Conceptually:

- RainMachine-style duration adjustment: scheduled day remains relatively fixed; runtime changes according to weather demand.
- Rachio-style adaptive frequency: soil-water deficit determines whether watering is needed; a zone may be skipped until depletion reaches the watering threshold.

A future RainMachine modification could potentially retain the controller's ET and soil calculations while changing the policy that turns those calculations into watering events.

### What RainMachine has made available

RainMachine published several components as open source, including mobile/web software, developer resources, weather-parser support, and the OpenWrt build used by the Mini-8. However, no public repository has yet been found containing the complete internal controller scheduling application.

RainMachine does support Python weather parsers running directly on the controller, demonstrating that portions of the controller software stack are Python and are designed to be extensible.

### Evidence about the internal controller application

RainMachine firmware notes, logs, support discussions, and developer material expose internal Python framework/module names including:

- `RMSimulatorFramework`
- `RMProgramsFramework`
- `rmProgramScheduler`
- `rmProgramSchedulerWatering`
- `rmProgramSchedulerCore`
- `RMParserFramework`
- `RMUtilsFramework`

Observed paths include `/rainmachine-app/RMParserFramework/...`, suggesting that the irrigation application itself resides under `/rainmachine-app`.

Firmware release notes also describe changes to scheduler and simulator modules, including calculations involving available water, ET0 and precipitation.

This strongly suggests that important parts of the irrigation engine may exist on the controller as Python code rather than solely as opaque native firmware.

### Adaptive Frequency

RainMachine itself added an **Adaptive Frequency** capability. Its documentation describes skipping non-optimal watering cycles based on calculated soil moisture.

The controller therefore already appears to maintain much of the state needed for a Rachio-like approach, including concepts such as:

- available water / soil-water balance
- field capacity and allowed depletion
- root depth
- crop coefficient
- application rate
- irrigation efficiency
- soil intake rate
- ET0
- precipitation / forecast precipitation

This raises the possibility that a future modification would not require implementing an irrigation model from scratch. It may instead be possible to modify the policy by which RainMachine's existing soil-water model determines watering frequency and duration.

### Schedule collision handling

A separate area for investigation is RainMachine's internal scheduler behavior when weather adjustment extends watering beyond the available time.

Questions include:

- How are overlapping programs serialized or prioritized?
- Does a program delayed by another program retain its full calculated runtime?
- What happens when total calculated irrigation exceeds the available watering window?
- Can zones/programs be deferred rather than extended into subsequent schedules?
- Does Adaptive Frequency participate in resolving these conflicts?
- Could a modified scheduler prioritize zones according to soil-water depletion and defer zones that can safely wait?

### Third-party/reverse-engineering status

Third-party RainMachine development found so far is primarily API integration and monitoring/control software rather than replacement firmware or a replacement internal scheduler. No publicly maintained fork of the complete RainMachine irrigation engine has yet been identified.

However, RainMachine provides SSH access on at least some controller families, and field logs expose Python filenames, line numbers, class/module names and internal watering state. It is therefore plausible that additional editable or recoverable code exists directly on the installed controller even though RainMachine has never published it in a source repository.

### Next investigation

The next step should be **read-only inspection of the actual RainMachine controller** before designing any replacement algorithm.

Via SSH, inventory `/rainmachine-app` and determine:

1. Which scheduler/simulator/framework modules are installed.
2. Whether they are ordinary `.py` source files, `.pyc` bytecode, packaged Python modules, or native binaries.
3. The Python version used by the controller.
4. Where the ET/weather adjustment is converted into zone runtime.
5. How available-water/soil-depletion state is maintained.
6. How Adaptive Frequency makes skip/run decisions.
7. How simultaneous or overlapping programs are queued and resolved.

No controller files should initially be modified. If readable source is present, copy the relevant application tree for offline analysis and version control.

### Architectural constraint

Any future work should preserve the existing design principle:

**RainMachine remains independently capable of irrigation scheduling and valve control. RainMachine2/Indigo observes status and provides supervisory control, but normal irrigation must not depend on Indigo, the Indigo host, or another external scheduler being available.**

The objective is therefore to investigate whether the autonomous RainMachine scheduler itself can be understood, preserved, and eventually modified or replaced in-place.


## 2026-09-20 — Read-only controller source investigation and public research

### Scope and evidence

Inspected the owner's Touch HD-16 through authorized read-only access; authentication details are omitted. Controller reports Android 4.3/API 18, Linux 3.2.0 ARMv7 and Python 2.7.8. `/rainmachine-app` is a symlink to `/system/rainmachine-app`. The requested frameworks contain readable Python source and matching Python 2.7 bytecode. Selected source was parsed/read in place using `python -B -S`; no application modules were imported or executed. No controller files were copied, edited, deleted or installed; no service was restarted. The prohibition on copying controller files remains in effect pending review. These notes are an authored summary, not a source export.

### Installed computation path

Source references below are relative to `/rainmachine-app`, at the time of inspection.

- `RMFormulaFramework/formula.py:29`: `asceDaily` calculates reference evapotranspiration. The parser/mixer and simulator infrastructure already handles forecasts, observed weather and historical fallbacks.
- `RMSimulatorFramework/rmSimulator.py:496–510`: selects estimated/historical ET, computes future demand and past forecast correction, reads carried available water, and computes net water need. Conceptually: future demand + past correction − available-water carryover.
- `rmSimulator.py:549–616`: future demand uses crop-adjusted ET and precipitation; past correction reconciles actual versus previously used weather, including rain sensitivity and limits.
- `rmSimulator.py:619–682`: turns need into a watering coefficient relative to future days × crop coefficient × average ET. Coefficient limits and the hot-days-extra-watering option apply. Estimated duration is coefficient × user/base duration.
- Adaptive Frequency specifically skips when `freq_modified > 0`, coefficient < `freq_modified / 100`, AND need < half the value returned by `getFieldCapacity(True)`. A skipped deficit is carried forward as negative available water. Minimum-runtime skips also carry deficit. This remains variable-duration irrigation with small-event suppression, not a direct fixed-refill-event, depletion-threshold policy.
- `RMDataFramework/rmMainDataRecords.py:398–408`: despite its name, `getFieldCapacity` returns (soil field capacity − permanent wilting) × root depth × allowed depletion, optionally multiplied by the user's savings coefficient. Thus the simulator's further division by two is half an already depletion-adjusted amount, not simply half the full soil reservoir.
- `rmMainDataRecords.py:528–536`: reference runtime uses average ET, maximum crop coefficient, precipitation/application rate and application efficiency. `rmPrograms.py:619–626` uses an explicit positive user duration when supplied, otherwise a reference duration.
- `rmSimulator.py:947–978`: available water is retrieved using BOTH program ID and zone ID, first from the main database and otherwise simulator data; carryover is bounded. This is not plainly a single physical moisture ledger per zone across all programs.
- `rmSimulator.py:687–733`: multiplies zone coefficient by base duration and duration coefficient to produce simulated watering time.

### Queue behavior and the overlap problem

- `RMProgramsFramework/rmProgramScheduler.py:86–121`: normal automatic scheduling uses the configured start opportunity and simulator result; manual runs follow a separate path.
- `rmProgramScheduler.py:173–207`: computed durations become valve queue records, appended in the normal automatic path.
- `rmValveQueue.py:15–95`: ordered queue, default one concurrent run, checks nominal start times and delay/master-valve entries. No soil-urgency ordering is evident in this path.
- `rmProgramSchedulerWatering.py:218–269`: starts a ready record at its actual dispatch time. `:114–120` finishes by actual start + machine duration. Consequently waiting behind another run does not, by itself, shorten the calculated runtime.
- `rmProgramSchedulerWatering.py:307–427` and `rmPrograms.py:1098–1122`: hourly restrictions can postpone a run; postponement beyond the day can remove queued automatic work. These are restriction safeguards, not evidence of an optimizer that packs all programs into an overall preferred window or chooses the least-stressed zone to defer.
- `rmProgramSchedulerWatering.py:277–296` persists the record's available water when removing an automatic record. Before changing the water ledger, audit partial/manual watering, rain interruptions and restriction removal end to end; physical application must not be inferred solely from a planned runtime.

This was static source inspection, not a live scheduling experiment. Actual configured program flags, water balances and historical overlaps have not yet been audited. No claim is made that all installations or firmware versions behave identically.

### Public RainMachine work: correction to the earlier notes

A public engine port DOES exist: [aroberts/rainmachine-rpi](https://github.com/aroberts/rainmachine-rpi). Its README describes firmware 4.0.1144 ported to Python 3 for Raspberry Pi 4, with the application, web UI, services and GPIO bridge. The repository contains simulator, scheduler, data and utility frameworks. The inspected `app/RMSimulatorFramework/rmSimulator.py` retains the same coefficient/Adaptive Frequency decision branch described above. It is valuable as a portability and offline-study reference, but does not establish a Rachio-like policy replacement or suitability for installation on this Android controller. No independent operational verification was performed. The README names a different clone owner; provenance and licensing need checking before reuse/distribution (GitHub reports no root license).

Other public work inspected:

- [Official developer resources](https://github.com/sprinkler/rainmachine-developer-resources): actual ET formula source, parser SDK, API clients and examples; not the complete scheduling engine.
- [dataoscar/rainmachine-fixes](https://github.com/dataoscar/rainmachine-fixes): contains a NOAA parser fix, not a scheduler replacement.
- [regenmaschine](https://github.com/bachya/regenmaschine): an API integration library, not an internal irrigation algorithm.

Searches of public repositories and documentation did not identify a verified, maintained RainMachine depletion-first/window-budget scheduler. This is a search result, not proof that no such work exists.

### What is public about Rachio

[Rachio's schedule overview](https://support.rachio.com/en_us/rachio-irrigation-schedule-overview-HJrFP8yYD) describes Flex Daily as daily, zone-by-zone decisions based on modeled soil moisture. Its [duration/frequency guide](https://support.rachio.com/en_us/adjust-watering-duration-frequency-of-flex-schedules-r10FDLkFw) distinguishes root depth, available water and allowed depletion (affecting event size and interval) from crop coefficient (affecting consumption/frequency). That guide contains contradictory prose about the direction of allowed-depletion changes; do not treat every sentence as an executable specification.

A [2018 support explanation](https://community.rachio.com/t/irrigation-on-field-capacity-chart-not-consistent-with-watering-times/15548) gives explicit formulas: event depth = root depth × allowed depletion × available water capacity; efficiency/distribution multiplier = 1/(0.4 + 0.6 × efficiency); runtime in minutes = 60 × event depth × user adjustment × multiplier / nozzle precipitation rate. These are historical disclosed formulas, not verified current production source or a complete specification of forecast/skip/queue behavior.

No production Flex Daily engine source was located in Rachio's public repositories or the searches performed. Public API clients should not be mistaken for the algorithm. Rachio's [offline behavior](https://support.rachio.com/en_us/offline-device-functionality-SyboPIkFv) also differs from the desired permanently autonomous RainMachine architecture; imitate the agronomic policy, not a cloud dependency.

### Independent, inspectable algorithm foundation

[FAO-56 chapter 8](https://www.fao.org/4/x0490e/x0490e0e.htm) documents total available water, readily available water and daily root-zone depletion. [pyfao56](https://github.com/kthorp/pyfao56) supplies actual model and automatic-irrigation source plus examples and scientific references. Its AutoIrrigate options include depletion thresholds, permitted weekdays, forecast rain handling, fixed application depths and minimum/maximum irrigation amounts. Source inspection confirmed model states for total available water and depletion, and threshold parameters in `src/pyfao56/autoirrigate.py`. This is NOT Rachio code and is best considered an offline reference model, not a drop-in package for Python 2.7 on the controller.

### Proposed direction, not an approved controller change

Preserve RainMachine's weather acquisition, autonomous operation and established valve/safety handling. Separate two decisions:

1. A per-zone soil-depletion policy determines whether watering is needed before the next permitted opportunity and chooses a bounded refill depth/runtime.
2. A capacity-aware planner fits needed runs, cycle/soak and valve delays into the allowed window; safely defers eligible zones while retaining deficit, and reports infeasible demand instead of silently extending the window or starving plants.

Frequency adjustment alone cannot guarantee that all zones fit on a high-demand day. The main deeper work is reconciling a physical per-zone balance across multiple programs and actual/manual/partial watering, preserving restriction and manual-control semantics, and defining what happens when required watering exceeds capacity. Prototype/replay this offline before any controller change. Copying controller source/data still requires the owner's separate go-ahead.

## 2026-09-21 — Fixed-event watering and equipment catalogue

Implemented the owner's fixed amount / weather-dependent frequency decision in
the editor and offline reference engine. Runtime events use explicit completed
refill assumptions without invented emitter rates. Fixed net-depth events use
rate and efficiency once. Legacy drafts retain their prior behavior until edited
and converted. Added catalogue CRUD, sources/conditions, geometry preview,
explicit application, snapshot provenance and JSON backup/import.

Validation: 64 Python tests and 406 headless browser tests passed; changed UI
modules passed ESLint, and UI packaging succeeded. Tests cover weather-independent
full runtime, cycle/soak and no-fit skips, completion/revision ledger semantics,
legacy compatibility, catalogue edits/deletion/import/stale saves and unchanged
program snapshots. One shared v2 fixture is reproduced by the browser form test
and consumed by the Python engine test. No live weather/sensor ingestion,
controller-side persistence or soil-water automatic dispatch is added.

## 2026-09-22 — mutually exclusive fixed-time programs and starter drafts

Implemented and installed the fixed days/times/duration editor option on the
dedicated test Pi, retaining shared priority and cycle/soak controls. Extended
the offline compiler/planner with exact fixed-time reservations, hard watering
restrictions, group conflict resolution and separate program identity on shared
valves. Fixed misting does not imply soil refill. Firmware dispatch is unchanged
and Soil water balance mode remains automatically paused.

Installed a private DEMO starter set: eight provisional soil programs plus
Salad's daily 12:15 three-minute misting program, no kitchen programs. Replaced
only the exact old review example; backed up the browser draft and prior UI
module. Verified the live Programs page lists nine drafts and the fixed editor
shows the priority selector while hiding soil calibration/refill fields.

Validation: 88 Python tests, 416 headless browser tests, ESLint and diff checks
passed. Tests cover same-valve separation, no misting refill credit, priorities,
restrictions, DST edges, malformed/exclusive schema fields, legacy compatibility,
shared-field persistence, independent deletion and once-only starter import.
The starter compile check reports only the five intentionally unconfigured
shared-profile inputs. No production controller changes or valve commands.

## 2026-09-23 — automatic virtual watering running on the test Pi

Implemented a persistent automatic laboratory runner in tools/valve_sim and
hosted it in the existing test UI service. It uses the reference planner, a 60x
virtual clock, explicitly synthetic 4 mm/day ETo/no rain, and an effective test
profile for blank fields. It applies saved browser drafts through a dedicated
API and provides Apply/Pause/Resume controls, active fake-valve state, plans,
soil balances and history. The nine existing starter drafts were applied via
the actual UI; no kitchen programs were added. Saved browser profile fields
were not overwritten. Production firmware dispatch remains unconnected.

Live verification on OSPI-Dev observed automatic Salad completion (60 virtual
seconds) and Artichokes completion (900 seconds), each with one assumed refill.
Salad's fixed mist ran exactly 12:15-12:18 virtual local time, logged 180 seconds
and refill=false. Cucumber stopped at 12:14:55 and resumed at 12:18:05 around the
reserved misting slot. UI history and backend completion records agreed. The
runner was left active with no reported error, continuing unattended against
the non-forwarding fake receiver. The ordinary firmware dashboard stays idle
because this harness does not submit commands to the firmware runtime queue.

Checks: 13 runner/API tests and 88 reference-engine tests passed; 418 headless
browser tests passed; ESLint and diff checks passed. Runner/API tests also
passed on the Pi. The live browser exposed a cache-busting query-string mismatch
on the status endpoint; it was corrected and covered by an API test before
starting the run. Commits da225121 and c524c216 contain the implementation/fix.

Persistent simulation state/history reside outside the served UI assets.
Atomic event-intent/completion writes prevent restart replay and double-refill;
clock/balance checkpoints every ten real seconds limit SD writes. A restart
interrupts uncertain events without full credit; a graceful service stop saves
a paused state. This is fake-receiver validation, not physical delivery proof.
See AUTOMATIC_SIMULATION.md for assumptions, operating steps and remaining gaps.
Only the test UI service and its served modules were changed; the test firmware,
production controllers and real valve bridge were not modified or operated.
# 23 September 2026 — native firmware queue and live OS weather

Implemented the Pi-only firmware integration documented in FIRMWARE_SCHEDULER.md.
The C++ process owns state/configuration and dispatch, invoking the existing
Python planner asynchronously as a one-shot component. This is not an embedded
C++ allocation-engine port. The old accelerated UI-worker scheduler was stopped.

Inspected/live findings: test Pi weather options selected AW without a key,
producing error 35. Default hosted-provider requests returned Apple historical
data with a local-midnight timestamp, daily ETo in inches and precipitation in
inches. The Pi's erroneous provider option was removed; normal OS weather error
became zero. The adapter stores dated days and replayable delivery separately,
with explicit persistence estimates for today and future ETo.

Live native-queue check: a temporary six-second runtime event was divided into
three two-second pulses. OS `/jc` reported program ID 98 in its queue. One refill
was journaled after the full event. A fixed three-second mist then ran with no
refill. A first attempt failed closed on fragmented receiver HTTP response data;
the fix accumulates and length-checks the response, with a regression test.
The original nine garden drafts were then copied into controller persistence,
with original blank soil profile and unknown initial depletion. Fixed misting
remains eligible while missing soil inputs visibly block soil allocations.

Tests: 419 browser tests; 88 reference-planner, 13 simulator/API and nine live-data
adapter tests; C++ persistence/restart, cycle completion, event identity, HTTP
fragmentation and imminent-start preservation checks. Build and smoke evidence
are private on the test Pi; no production-controller requests or real valve
routes were used.

## 2026-09-23 — owner-approved provisional garden soil baseline

The owner explicitly requested provisional soil profile and starting moisture
values. Backed up the private checkpoint, paused, saved the existing nine
programs unchanged with `site.provisional=true` and a new baseline, then resumed.
Effective defaults: available-water capacity 100 mm/m, root depth 0.3 m,
allowed depletion 50%, crop coefficient 1, effective rain 80%. Initial depletion
is 15 mm per zone, the default profile's watering threshold. These remain
explicit assumptions, not field measurements; blank calibration fields were
not overwritten. Configuration revision is 4.

Live verification observed all eight soil programs allocated full events,
no soil-input/runtime errors, and Salad's simulated valve ON at 16:03:01 local
time. Real OS Apple weather remains connected. The fixed midday mist is retained
for 12:15 the following day. All outputs remain the isolated fake receiver.

## 2026-09-24 — external-control reservation programs installed

Implemented schema 5's mutually exclusive, valve-free reservation option,
reusing fixed-program weekday/start-time and shared duration controls. Mandatory
periods plus transition margins are subtracted before fixed/soil allocation and
future service selection. Dated periods include overnight carryover and
conservative DST handling. No reservation becomes an executable valve event or
soil delivery. Priority group maintenance ignores these groupless programs.

The firmware guards the whole native queue in soil scheduling mode, including
manual and run-once work. Conflicting queue entries are cancelled and logged;
missing or expired reservation coverage fails closed. Prior Standard mode is
unchanged. See EXTERNAL_RESERVATIONS.md for manual API acknowledgement semantics.

Installed `ac3902eb` on the Pi. Live test: a temporary two-minute reservation
already in progress blocked a two-second manual request, with receiver sequence
unchanged. After the reservation and five-second transition gap, another request
produced exactly one ON/OFF pair. The original nine garden programs and initial
baseline were restored without resetting their eight refill records; revision 6,
automatic scheduling resumed. No permanent pool-refill hours were invented.
The browser visibly showed only reservation fields when the option was selected.

Validation: 421 browser, 97 reference-planner, ten firmware-worker and thirteen
simulator/API tests passed, plus C++ durable-state/interval guard checks. Targeted
Python and C++ checks passed on the Pi; both deployed UI modules match source.
Private evidence and backup locations are in NEXT_SESSION.md. Production
RainMachine, Indigo automation and real valve control remain unchanged.
